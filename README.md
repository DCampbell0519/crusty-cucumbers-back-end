## Description:
Crusty Cucumbers is a stylish and simple app for collecting and reviewing some of your favorite (and not so favorite) movies and tv shows.  And we know what you may be thinking, "We prefer tomatoes".  We say that's fair, but at least here, you don't need to worry about moderation.  It's probably because we're not as popular yet, but still... 

## Getting Started:
- Clone the repo to your local repository
- Install dependencies
- Set up your environment variables with a ```.env``` file.  Add the following to said file: 
    - ```MONGODB_URI=<your-MongoDB-Connection-String>```
    - ```OMDB_API_KEY=<your-api-key>```
    - ```JWT_SECRET=<your-JWT-string```
- Run the development server: ```nodemon```  
- Server will run on http://localhost:3000

## Technologies Used:
- React
- React Router 
- CORS
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- OMDB API (omdbapi.com)
- Heroku
- Express
- JWT
- BCrypt
- MongoDB
- Node
- GitHub

## Stretch Goals:
- Create a Community Page, that would allow a logged in user to view other users in the database, view their profiles, which movies they've reviewed, comment on other people's reviews, etc.
- A light mode/dark mode toggle button.
